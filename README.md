# A* Algorithm for Robot Path Planning
A* Algorithm for Robot Path Planning
Robots are built to to work under dynamically changing environment or workspace and hence the algorithm or the rules must be devised to ensure an optimistic collision-free path. A* algorithm is a heuristic function based algorithm for optimal path planning. It calculates heuristic function's value at each node on the workspace and checks the adjacent nodes for finding the optimal solution with zero probability of collision.
